# Portfolio Website created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript
 - Included the projects I wanted to showcase but will update them as I improve them.
 - Will upload better projects once I finish them.
 - My games are created with python using pygame, except for Snake(I used html with JavaScripted into the html file)
 - My contact form uses a thirdparty site to directly connect to my personal email.
 - I used personal images, and some googled images to enhance my site. I plan on learning on how to make my own pixel and texture art so that one day I can improve my website to a more desired theme of my choice.
